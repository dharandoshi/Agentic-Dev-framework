When I send the prompt, it does launch the Scrum master, but the Scrum Master is not. Following the proper flow. So I gave it a prompt and then it started right away with creating the Sprint. zero. Rather than it should 1st without doing anything, it should 1st delegate the things to the requirements in a list. The requirements analyst should create the required documents, not just requirements. It should create all the documents. That I needed. Then based on those requirements, the technical architect should design the proper structure also while doing. All of this. Both the agents should ask the stuff to me. Like they should conform and they should ask about the various questions about the project, the vision, the overall scope, the technology. They should get confirmations before finalizing things. Once this is done, they should report back to the Scrum Master and then the Scrum Master should prepare the complete project development plan and then move the things or give the things to technically. The tech lead right now is also not behaving properly. The tech lead started creating the project right away and it started the development work. Whereas it should. Start the respective front end and back end agents as per the requirement. The role of tech lead is to gather the complete. Documentation. Both requirements, the scope and the technical and then sort of assign the things in a proper flow so that the development can be smoother and better. I want you to analyze. All these agents and ensure that they are following the proper flow. They are not just focusing on creating stuff. They are utilizing the MCPS.
