## Common Tools and Patterns

### Most Frequently Used Tools

1. **Core File Operations**:
   - `Read` - Universal across all agents
   - `Write` - Development agents only
   - `Edit/MultiEdit` - Development agents only
   - `Glob` - For file discovery

2. **MCP Workspace Tools** (All agents):
   - `mcp__workspace__analyze` - Project analysis
   - `mcp__workspace__context` - Context understanding
   - `mcp__workspace__find` - File location
   - `mcp__workspace__check_duplicates` - Prevent redundancy
   - `mcp__workspace__existing_patterns` - Pattern consistency

3. **MCP Documentation** (Most agents):
   - `mcp__docs__register` - Document registration
   - `mcp__docs__find` - Document discovery
   - `mcp__docs__search` - Content search

4. **MCP Coordination** (All agents):
   - `mcp__coord__task_status` - Progress tracking
   - `mcp__coord__task_handoff` - Work transfer
   - `mcp__coord__message_send` - Communication
   - `mcp__coord__escalation_create` - Issue escalation

5. **MCP Context7** (Development agents):
   - `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` - Library resolution
   - `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - Documentation fetch

6. **MCP Logging** (ALL agents - MANDATORY):
   - `mcp__logging__log_event` - General events
   - `mcp__logging__log_task_start/complete/failed` - Task lifecycle
   - `mcp__logging__log_handoff` - Work transfers
   - `mcp__logging__log_decision` - Important decisions
   - `mcp__logging__log_tool_use` - Tool usage tracking

## Shared Protocols and Behaviors

### 1. Working Directory Protocol (CRITICAL)
**Every agent MUST**:
- Use the CURRENT working directory
- NEVER create project subfolders
- Check with `pwd` first
- Read `.claude/shared-context.md`
- Use existing structure

### 2. BMAD Methodology Alignment
- **Planning Phase**: Requirements Analyst → System Architect
- **Architecture Phase**: System Architect → Engineering Manager
- **Development Phase**: Engineering Manager → Development Teams
- **Quality Phase**: QA Engineer → DevOps Engineer

### 3. Documentation Standards
All agents follow:
- Document discovery before creation
- Registration with MCP docs server
- Version tracking
- Owner attribution
- Category classification

### 4. Logging Protocol
Mandatory for all agents:
- Log file operations BEFORE performing
- Log important decisions with rationale
- Log task lifecycle (start/complete/fail)
- Log handoffs with context
- Human-readable format in `.claude/logs/`

### 5. Communication Patterns
- Structured message format
- Task IDs for traceability
- Priority levels (critical/high/medium/low)
- Response requirements
- Context preservation in handoffs

## Workflow Patterns and Handoff Mechanisms

### Primary Workflow: BMAD Full Cycle
```
1. Requirements Analyst → Creates PRD & Project Brief
2. System Architect → Receives PRD, creates Architecture Document
3. Engineering Manager → Receives Architecture, assigns parallel tasks
4. Development Teams → Work simultaneously:
   - Senior Backend Engineer
   - Senior Frontend Engineer
   - Data Engineer
   - Security Engineer
5. QA Engineer → Validates all implementations
6. DevOps Engineer → Deploys to production
```

### Handoff Patterns (from orchestrator.py)
```python
'handoff_patterns': {
    'scrum-master': ['engineering-manager', 'requirements-analyst'],
    'engineering-manager': ['senior-backend-engineer', 'senior-frontend-engineer', 
                           'system-architect', 'security-engineer', 'data-engineer'],
    'requirements-analyst': ['system-architect', 'technical-writer'],
    'system-architect': ['engineering-manager'],
    'senior-backend-engineer': ['qa-engineer', 'security-engineer'],
    'senior-frontend-engineer': ['qa-engineer', 'technical-writer'],
    'qa-engineer': ['devops-engineer'],
    'devops-engineer': ['engineering-manager']
}
```

### Collaboration Requirements
Certain tasks require multiple agents:
- **API Design**: Backend + Frontend engineers
- **Security Review**: Security + Backend engineers
- **Deployment**: DevOps + SRE engineers
- **Data Pipeline**: Data + Integration engineers

## Agent Hierarchy and Communication Flow

### Reporting Chain
```
Scrum Master
├── Engineering Manager
│   ├── Senior Backend Engineer
│   ├── Senior Frontend Engineer
│   ├── QA Engineer
│   ├── DevOps Engineer
│   ├── Security Engineer
│   ├── Data Engineer
│   ├── System Architect
│   └── Technical Writer
├── Requirements Analyst
└── Project Initializer
```

### Communication Flow Types

1. **Vertical Communication** (Reporting):
   - Status updates up the chain
   - Escalations to managers
   - Approvals from leadership

2. **Horizontal Communication** (Collaboration):
   - API contract negotiation
   - Integration coordination
   - Cross-team dependencies

3. **Handoff Communication** (Sequential):
   - Work package transfer
   - Context preservation
   - Artifact sharing

## Current Logging Implementation

### What's Implemented
- Comprehensive logging protocol defined
- MCP logging server integration
- Human-readable format specification
- Task lifecycle tracking
- Decision logging with rationale

### Log Format Example
```
[2025-01-09 10:15:24] REQUIREMENTS     | FILE READ     | docs/existing-requirements.md
[2025-01-09 10:16:12] REQUIREMENTS     | FILE WRITE    | docs/project-brief.md
[2025-01-09 10:18:45] REQUIREMENTS     | FILE EDIT     | docs/prd.md - Added functional requirements
[2025-01-09 10:20:20] SYSTEM-ARCH      | DECISION      | Selected PostgreSQL for ACID compliance
```

### Gaps Identified
1. Not all agents consistently use logging
2. Missing automated log aggregation
3. No real-time log visualization
4. Limited error recovery logging
5. No performance metrics logging

## Recommendations for Base Agent Design

### 1. Create Abstract Base Agent Template
```markdown
---
name: base-agent
tools: [MINIMAL_COMMON_TOOLS]
model: sonnet (default)
color: gray
---

# Common sections all agents should have:
- Purpose with role boundaries
- Working directory rules (mandatory)
- BMAD alignment section
- Communication protocol
- Logging requirements
- Documentation standards
- Handoff procedures
```

### 2. Tool Standardization
**Minimal Base Toolset**:
- Read (universal)
- mcp__workspace__* (context awareness)
- mcp__docs__* (documentation)
- mcp__coord__* (communication)
- mcp__logging__* (mandatory logging)
- mcp__monitoring__* (health reporting)

**Role-Specific Additions**:
- Development agents: Write, Edit, validation, execution
- Management agents: Task management, workload monitoring
- Analysis agents: Search, context analysis

### 3. Enhanced Coordination Features
- Implement automatic progress tracking
- Add dependency resolution
- Create work queue management
- Implement automatic escalation triggers
- Add performance benchmarking

### 4. Improved Logging Implementation
- Create logging wrapper functions
- Implement automatic log context injection
- Add structured logging with JSON output option
- Create log analysis dashboard
- Implement alert triggers for failures

### 5. Agent Health Monitoring
- Add heartbeat mechanism
- Track agent utilization
- Monitor response times
- Implement circuit breakers
- Add automatic recovery procedures

### 6. Documentation Improvements
- Create agent capability matrix
- Build interactive agent selection guide
- Generate automatic handoff documentation
- Create workflow visualization tools
- Implement knowledge base system

### 7. Testing Framework for Agents
- Create agent behavior tests
- Implement handoff validation
- Add communication protocol tests
