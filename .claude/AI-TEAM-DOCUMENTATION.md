# AI Development Team Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AI development team agents, their specializations, and coordination system. The team consists of 27 specialized agents working through a standardized communication protocol to deliver production-grade software.

### Coordination System
All agents follow the standardized communication protocol defined in `.claude/agents/team-coordination.md`. The system ensures seamless collaboration through:
- Unified message format with UUID tracking
- Hierarchical task flow from strategic to implementation levels
- Real-time status broadcasting and monitoring
- Clear escalation paths and dependency resolution
- Parallel execution capabilities with synchronization points

## Agent Coordination Infrastructure

The team uses the following coordination infrastructure located in `.claude/agents/`:

### Core Files
- **team-coordination.md** - Complete communication protocol and coordination system
- **agent-registry.json** - Real-time agent status and hierarchy tracking
- **Individual agent files** - 27 specialized agent definitions with embedded protocols

### Working Directory Structure
Agents work within the actual project structure (not a fake `core/` directory):
- Agents analyze and work with existing project files
- No predefined directory structure is enforced
- Agents adapt to the project's actual organization
- Communication happens through the protocol, not file directories

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Message Format
All agents communicate using the standardized format defined in `.claude/agents/team-coordination.md`:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid-v4",
  "from": "sending-agent-name",
  "to": "receiving-agent-name",
  "type": "task|report|query|response|notification|status|handoff",
  "priority": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "subject": "brief description",
  "payload": {
    "content": "detailed message content",
    "context": {},
    "dependencies": [],
    "deadline": "ISO-8601 (optional)",
    "artifacts": []
  },
  "status": "pending|in_progress|completed|blocked|failed",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "correlation_id": "original-request-id",
  "thread_id": "conversation-thread-id"
}
```

### Agent Status States
- **available**: Ready to receive tasks
- **busy**: Currently executing a task
- **blocked**: Waiting for dependencies
- **error**: Task failed, needs intervention
- **offline**: Agent not available

## Workflow Example

### Task Flow Through Hierarchy

1. **Strategic Level (Level 1)**
   - `product-owner` defines business requirements
   - `system-architect` creates technical design
   - `cloud-architect` designs infrastructure

2. **Tactical Level (Level 2)**
   - `scrum-master` receives requirements from product-owner
   - Plans sprints and breaks down into tasks
   - `tech-lead` defines technical standards

3. **Operational Level (Level 3)**
   - `team-orchestrator` receives tasks from scrum-master
   - Checks agent availability
   - Assigns tasks to implementation agents
   - Resolves dependencies

4. **Implementation Level (Level 4)**
   - Agents receive tasks from team-orchestrator
   - Report progress at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
   - Escalate blockers to appropriate level
   - Hand off completed work to tech-lead for review

### Parallel Execution Example
```json
{
  "type": "task",
  "from": "team-orchestrator",
  "to": "broadcast",
  "payload": {
    "parallel": true,
    "tasks": [
      {"agent": "database-engineer", "task": "design-schema"},
      {"agent": "api-designer", "task": "design-endpoints"},
      {"agent": "senior-frontend-engineer", "task": "design-ui"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Production Standards

All agents adhere to these production standards:

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ No stub code or TODOs
- ‚úÖ Complete error handling
- ‚úÖ Minimum 80% test coverage
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks met
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerabilities: zero

### Documentation
- ‚úÖ Inline code documentation
- ‚úÖ API documentation
- ‚úÖ User guides
- ‚úÖ Deployment instructions

### Testing
- ‚úÖ Unit tests
- ‚úÖ Integration tests
- ‚úÖ E2E tests
- ‚úÖ Performance tests
- ‚úÖ Security tests

### Deployment
- ‚úÖ Containerized applications
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure as Code
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipelines
- ‚úÖ Monitoring and alerting
- ‚úÖ Rollback procedures

## Escalation Paths

### Technical Issues
`implementation-agent ‚Üí tech-lead ‚Üí system-architect`

### Scope/Requirement Issues
`implementation-agent ‚Üí scrum-master ‚Üí product-owner`

### Resource Conflicts
`implementation-agent ‚Üí team-orchestrator ‚Üí scrum-master`

### Critical Failures
`any-agent ‚Üí scrum-master ‚Üí broadcast to all coordinators`

## Usage Guidelines

### Starting a New Project
1. Invoke `requirements-analyst` to gather requirements interactively
2. Invoke `project-initializer` to parse requirements into tasks
3. Invoke `scrum-master` to plan sprints and prioritize
4. Let `team-orchestrator` manage task distribution

### Agent Invocation Methods
- **Automatic**: Based on task keywords matching agent specialization
- **Explicit**: By mentioning agent name directly
- **Hierarchical**: Through proper chain of command
- **Parallel**: Via team-orchestrator for concurrent tasks

### Communication Best Practices
1. Always include correlation_id for task tracking
2. Use appropriate priority levels (critical > high > medium > low)
3. Report status changes immediately
4. Include artifacts in handoff messages
5. Escalate blockers through proper channels

## Maintenance

### Adding New Agents
Use `god-agent` to create new agents with proper configuration

### Updating Agents
Use `god-agent` to modify existing agent capabilities

### Agent Health Checks
- Check `agent-registry.json` for current agent status
- team-orchestrator monitors agent availability
- scrum-master tracks task completion rates
