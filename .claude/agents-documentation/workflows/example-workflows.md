## üí° Tips for Effective Workflows

1. **Chain Agents Naturally**: Let each agent's output inform the next agent's input
2. **Use Coordination Tools**: Leverage `mcp__coord__*` tools for task tracking
3. **Document Decisions**: Have technical-writer capture important decisions
4. **Security First**: Include security-engineer early in the workflow
5. **Test Continuously**: Include qa-engineer at multiple stages
6. **Monitor Everything**: Use monitoring dashboard to track workflow progress

---

## üìä Tracking Workflow Progress

```bash
# Create a workflow task
"Use mcp__coord__task_create to create a feature development workflow"

# Check workflow status
"Use mcp__coord__workflow_status to check current progress"

# View in dashboard
python3 .claude/scripts/monitoring-dashboard.py
```
